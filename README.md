# Simulation-of-Charged-Particles-in-Earth-s-Magnetic-Field
Several files for the simulation of charged particles in earth's magnetic field

These files are still a work-in-progress, so they might not function correctly. The endgoal is to create a simple library for anyone to use to generate particle motion in magnetic fields. 

I am currently working on integrating the boris scheme, as it did not work with the Euler scheme (not precise enough). This has made it better, but there is still the main issue, which is that the particle will return at some point.
